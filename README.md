This project is purely made by using HTML and CSS. in the main file i.e index.html we have three links which will take us to different pages for eg login, placing order , contact us.
in the login page we can put our email id and password but when we press login button nothing will happen as it is not fucnctional. further for placing a order ,
we need to give details of the product along with the address of the buyer and we will click on submit to place the order, moreover there is  a last option which will have contact
and feedback option.
